/**
 * Sacrificial watchdog process that resets the terminal if the CLI dies
 * without running its own cleanup (SIGKILL, native crash, group kill).
 *
 * The in-process handlers (renderer-cleanup.ts) cover catchable exits, and
 * the npm wrapper resets when it outlives the binary — but neither survives
 * `pkill -9 node`-style sweeps that take out the wrapper and binary together,
 * and dev/direct-binary runs have no wrapper at all. This covers those.
 *
 * POSIX:
 * - We spawn a detached `/bin/sh` whose stdin is a pipe from this process.
 *   `sh` isn't named node/bun/codebuff/freebuff, so process-name kill sweeps
 *   miss it, and `detached` puts it in its own session so process-group kills
 *   miss it too.
 * - The watchdog blocks on `cat` until the pipe hits EOF — which only happens
 *   when this process is gone, however it died — then writes the reset
 *   sequences to its stdout, which is a dup of our stdout (the terminal).
 *   It must NOT open /dev/tty: being in its own session it has no controlling
 *   terminal, so that open fails with ENXIO. Writing to an inherited tty fd
 *   needs no controlling terminal.
 * - On clean shutdown we SIGKILL the watchdog first (process.kill is
 *   synchronous), so it never fires and the normal cleanup path owns the
 *   terminal writes.
 *
 * Windows (closes the codebuff#843 after-exit gap, where the hosting
 * terminal keeps sending mouse/focus VT input that the shell echoes as
 * `^[[<35;12;7M` gibberish):
 * - Bun/libuv put direct children in a kill-on-job-close job object, so a
 *   plain child — detached or not — is terminated the moment we die
 *   (oven-sh/bun#31603) and can never fire. Grandchildren of job members are
 *   NOT added to the job (silent-breakaway semantics), so we launch a
 *   short-lived PowerShell bootstrap (in the job; its death doesn't matter)
 *   that uses Start-Process -NoNewWindow to spawn the real watchdog outside
 *   the job, attached to our console.
 * - The pipe/EOF trick can't cross the bootstrap hop, so the watchdog
 *   detects our death with `Wait-Process -Id <our pid>` instead, then writes
 *   the reset sequences to its console stdout (ConPTY forwards the disable
 *   sequences to the hosting terminal).
 * - We hold no handle to the grandchild, so clean shutdown can't kill it.
 *   Instead stopTerminalWatchdog() synchronously drops a disarm file; the
 *   watchdog checks it after Wait-Process and exits silently when present.
 * - Windows PowerShell 5.1 always exists; scripts go through -EncodedCommand
 *   (base64 UTF-16LE) so no command-line quoting can break them.
 * - Arming takes a few hundred ms (PowerShell boot); deaths inside that
 *   window fall back to the pre-existing behavior (npm wrapper or nothing).

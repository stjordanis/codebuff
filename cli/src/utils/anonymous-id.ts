/**
 * Persistent anonymous analytics id.
 *
 * Pre-login events (e.g. `cli.app_launched`) are captured under this id and
 * later aliased to the real user id on login. If the id were regenerated every
 * process start, each pre-login launch would become a distinct "person" in
 * PostHog — only the launch where login happens gets aliased, and every prior
 * launch is orphaned at the top of the funnel, inflating the apparent drop-off.
 *
 * Persisting it to the config dir means all of a user's pre-login launches
 * collapse to a single person that aliases cleanly into their account.
 *
 * Deliberately a per-install random UUID, NOT the hardware fingerprint from
 * `fingerprint.ts`: the fingerprint is intentionally deterministic across
 * reinstalls (for anti-abuse), so reusing it here would alias a fresh install
 * into a previous user's PostHog person — cross-account identity bleed. Keep
 * the two identities separate.
